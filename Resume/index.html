                My expertise is primarily in client-side UI development.I have
                worked on a number of iOS apps, and Web Apps. I have a strong
                interest in AI technologies, in particular, Deep Learning, and
                have devoted a large chunk of my time to learning the math,
                theory, and core concepts behind the latest progress in the
                field. I also have experience working with design software such
                as Sketch and Figma, and have designed a number of app concepts
                and custom icons using these tools.

              <h2>Cue Calendar - iOS Engineer</h2>
              <p class="subDetails">Apr 2019 - Mar 2020</p>
              <p>
                Cue is an iOS app that makes it easier for people to make plans
                with their friends, discover events, and manage their social
                lives.
                <span style="font-style: italic;"
                  >The app is built using the Swift programming language, and
                  there is a custom GRPC-based state management layer with UI
                  built on native components and LayoutKit.</span
                >
                My contribution was around delivering quick feature iterations,
                pixel-perfect design spec implementations, and an overall smooth
                iOS experiences.

              <h2>Oculus - Software Engineer</h2>
              <p class="subDetails">Aug 2017 - Nov 2018</p>
              <p>
                I worked on a product called Oculus Dash, which is an Overlay VR
                system built into the Oculus 2.0 OS.
                <span style="font-style: italic;"
                  >The technology included React Native, React VR and Flow JS. I
                  occasionally developed on the C++ stack, which was using an
                  in-house rendering engine designed for lightening-fast load
                  times.</span
                >
                My main project was to develop a system for tracking the
                movement / placement of 2D window overlays in 3D space. I also
                created a multi-threaded javascript react interface that
                communicated directly with the C++ ReactVR stack.

              <h2>Facebook - Front-End Engineer</h2>
              <p class="subDetails">Jun 2015 - Aug 2017</p>
              <p>
                I built internal tools for (1) performance / latency tracking of
                Facebook's Web Tier and (2) Data Center Cluster Management and
                Planning. The technology stack included javascript, FlowJS,
                Redux, SVG, WebGL, and ThreeJS.
